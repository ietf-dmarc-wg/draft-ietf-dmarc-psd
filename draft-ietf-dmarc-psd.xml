   <abstract>
      <t>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
         (DMARC) permits a domain-controlling organization to express
         domain-level policies and preferences for message validation,
         disposition, and reporting, which a mail-receiving organization
         can use to improve mail handling.</t>
      <t>DMARC distinguishes the portion of a name that is a
         Public Suffix Domain (PSD), below which
         organizational domain names are created.  The basic DMARC
         capability allows organizational domains to specify policies
         that apply to their subdomains, but it does not give that
         capability to PSDs. This document describes an extension to
         DMARC to fully enable DMARC functionality for PSDs.</t>
      <t>Some implementations of DMARC consider a PSD to be ineligible for
         DMARC enforcement.  This specification addresses that case.</t>

   <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
     <t>DMARC <xref target="RFC7489"/> provides a mechanism for publishing
        organizational policy information to email receivers.  DMARC allows policy to be
        specified for both individual domains and for organizational domains
        and their sub-domains within a single organization.</t>
     <t>To determine the organizational domain for a message under evaluation,
        and thus where to look for a policy statement, DMARC makes use of a public suffix
        list. The process for doing this can be found in Section 3.2 of the DMARC
        specification.  Currently, the public suffix list being used is the
        most common one that is maintained by the Mozilla Foundation and made public at
        <eref target="http://publicsuffix.org">http://publicsuffix.org</eref>.</t>
     <t>In the basic DMARC model, Public Suffix Domains (PSDs) are not organizational domains
        and are thus not subject to DMARC processing.  In DMARC, domains
        fall into one of three categories: organizational domains,
        sub-domains of organizational domains, or PSDs.  A PSD can only
        publish DMARC policy for itself, and not for any sub-domains
        under it.  In some cases, this limitation allows for the abuse
        of non-existent organizational-level domains and hampers
        identification of domain abuse in email.</t>
     <t>This document specifies experimental updates to the DMARC
        specification cited above, in an attempt to mitigate this abuse.</t>
   <section anchor="example" title="Example">
     <t>As an example, imagine a Top-Level Domain (TLD), ".example", that has
        public subdomains for government and commercial use (".gov.example"
        and ".com.example").  The maintainer of a list of such a PSD structure
        would include entries for both of these sub-domains, thereby
        indicating that they are PSDs, below which organizational domains can
        be registered.  Suppose further that there exists a legitimate domain
        called "tax.gov.example", registered within ".gov.example".</t>
     <t>However, by exploiting the typically unauthenticated nature
       of email, there are regular malicious campaigns to impersonate this
       organization that use similar-looking ("cousin") domains such as
       "t4x.gov.example".  Such domains are not registered.</t>
     <t>Within the ".gov.example" public suffix, use of DMARC has been mandated,
        so "gov.example" publishes the following DMARC DNS record:
         <figure><artwork>
_dmarc.gov.example. IN TXT ( "v=DMARC1; p=reject;"
                             "rua=mailto:dmc@dmarc.svc.gov.example" )
        </artwork></figure>
       This DMARC record provides policy and a reporting destination for
       mail sent from @gov.example.  Similarly, "tax.gov.example" will have
       a DMARC record that specifies policy for mail sent from addresses
       @tax.gov.example.  However, due to DMARC's current method of
       discovering and applying policy at the organizational domain
       level, the non-existent organizational domain of @t4x.gov.example
       does not and cannot fall under a DMARC policy.

     </t>
     <t> Defensively registering all variants of "tax" is not a scalable
         strategy.  The intent of this specification, therefore, is to enhance the
         DMARC discovery method by enabling an agent receiving such a
         message to be able to determine that a relevant policy is present at
         "gov.example", which is precluded by the current DMARC specification.
     </t>
   </section>
   <section anchor="discussion" title="Discussion">
     <t> This document provides a simple extension to <xref target="RFC7489"/>
         to allow operators of Public Suffix Domains (PSDs) to:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Express policy at the level of the PSD that covers all
          organizational domains that do not explicitly publish DMARC records</t>
        <t>Extends the DMARC policy query functionality to detect
            and process such a policy</t>
       <t>Describes receiver feedback for such policies</t>
       <t>Provides controls to mitigate potential privacy considerations
       associated with this extension</t>
     </list>
     </t>
     <t>This document also provides a new DMARC tag
	to indicate requested handling policy for non-existent subdomains.
	This is provided specifically to support phased deployment of PSD
	DMARC, but is expected to be useful more generally.  Undesired
	rejection risks for mail purporting to be from domains that do not
	exist are substantially lower than for those that do, so the
	operational risk of requesting harsh policy treatment (e.g., reject) is
	lower.
     </t>
     <t>As an additional benefit, the PSD DMARC extension clarifies
	existing requirements.  Based on the requirements of <xref
        target="RFC7489"/>, DMARC should function above the
        organizational level for exact domain matches (i.e., if a DMARC record
        were published for "example", then mail from example@example should be
        subject to DMARC processing).  Testing had revealed that this is not
        consistently applied in different implementations.
     </t>
     <t>There are two types of Public Suffix Operators (PSOs) for which this
         extension would be useful and appropriate:
     </t>
         <t><list style="symbols">
                  <t>Branded PSDs (e.g., ".google"): These domains are
                      effectively Organizational Domains as discussed in <xref
                      target="RFC7489"/>.  They control all
                      subdomains of the tree.  These are effectively private
                      domains, but listed in the current public suffix list.
                      They are
                      treated as Public for DMARC
                      purposes.  They require the same protections as DMARC
                      Organizational Domains, but are currently unable to
                      benefit from DMARC.
                  </t>
                  <t>Multi-organization PSDs that require DMARC usage (e.g.,
                      ".bank"):  Because existing Organizational Domains using
                      this PSD have their own DMARC policy, the applicability of
                      this extension is for non-existent domains.  The extension
                      allows the brand protection benefits of DMARC to extend to
                      the entire PSD,
                      including cousin domains of registered organizations.
                  </t>
          </list></t>
     <t>Due to the design of DMARC and the nature
         of the Internet <xref target="RFC5598">email architecture</xref>, there
         are interoperability issues associated with
         DMARC deployment.  These are discussed in <xref target="RFC7960">
         Interoperability Issues between DMARC and Indirect Email Flows</xref>.
         These issues are not typically applicable to PSDs, since they (e.g., the
         ".gov.example" used above) do not typically send mail.

           <t> The global Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is documented in
               numerous RFCs.  It defines a tree of names
               starting with root, ".", immediately below which are Top Level
               Domain names such as ".com" and ".us".

               The domain name structure consists of a tree of names, each of
               which is made of a sequence of words ("labels") separated by
               period characters.  The root of the tree is simply called ".".
               The Internet community at large, through processes and policies
               external to this work, selects points in this tree at which to
               register domain names "owned" by independent organizations.
               Real-world examples are ".com", ".org", ".us", and ".gov.uk".
               Names at which such registrations occur are called Public
               Suffix Domains (PSDs), and a registration consists of a label
               selected by the registrant to which a desirable PSD is
               appended.  For example, "ietf.org" is a registered domain name,
               and ".org" is its PSD.

		      reports redirected to the PSO.  The content of such

		      sensitive.

          <t>PSOs will receive feedback on non-existent domains, which may be
              similar to existing Organizational Domains.  Feedback related to
              such cousin domains have a small risk of carrying information
              related to an actual Organizational Domain.  To minimize
              this potential concern, PSD DMARC feedback MUST be limited
              to Aggregate Reports. Feedback Reports carry more detailed
              information and present a greater risk.
          </t>
	  <t>Due to the inherent Privacy and Security risks associated with
	      PSD DMARC for Organizational Domains in multi-organization PSDs
        that do not participate in DMARC, any Feedback Reporting
        related to multi-organizational PSDs MUST be limited
        to non-existent domains
        except in cases where the reporter knows that PSO
	      requires use of DMARC.

      <t> The risks of the issues identified in <xref target="RFC7489"/>,
	  Section 12.3, DNS Security, are amplified by PSD DMARC.  In

      <t> The risks of the issues identified in <xref target="RFC7489"/>,
	  Section 12.5, External Reporting Addresses, are amplified by PSD
	  DMARC.  By design, PSD DMARC causes unrequested reporting of feedback
	  to entities external to the Organizational Domain.  This is discussed

   <section anchor="experiment"
    title="PSD DMARC Privacy Concern Mitigation Experiment">

<t>The experiment being performed has three different questions which are
looking to be addressed in this document. </t>
    <t><list style="symbols">

    <t>Section 3.2 modifies policy discovery to add an additional DNS lookup.
    To determine if this lookup is useful, PSDs will add additional DMARC records
    in place, and will analyze the DMARC reports.  Success will be determined
    if a consensus of PSDs that publish DMARC records are able to collect useful data.</t>
    <t>Section 3.2 adds the "np" tag for non-existent subdomains (DNS NXDOMAIN).
    PSOs wishing to test this will add this flag to their DMARC record, and will
    analyze DMARC reports for deployment.  Success will be determined if
    organizations find explicitly blocking non-existent subdomains domains
    desirable and provide added value. </t>
    <t> Section 4.1 discusses three cases where providing feedback could cause
    information to leak out of an organization.   This experiment will analyze
    the feedback reports generated for each case to determine if there is
    information leakage.</t>
</list></t>

   </section>
   <section anchor="registry" title="DMARC PSD Registry Examples">
	   <t> To facilitate experimentation around data leakage mitigation, samples
	       of the DNS based and IANA like registries are available at
	       <xref target="psddmarc.org"/>.
           </t>
	<section anchor="dnsregistry" title="DMARC PSD DNS Query Service">
	   <t> A sample stand-alone DNS query service is available at <xref
	       target="psddmarc.org"/>.  It was developed based on the contents
	       suggested for an IANA registry in an earlier revision of this draft.
	       Usage of the service is described on the web site.
           </t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="iana2" title="DMARC Public Suffix Domain (PSD) Registry">
	   <t> <xref target="psddmarc.org"/> provides an IANA like DMARC Public
	       Suffix Domain (PSD) Registry as a stand-alone DNS query service.  It
	       follows the contents and structure described below.  There is a Comma
	       Separated Value (CSV) version of the listed PSD domains which is
	       suitable for use in build updates for PSD DMARC capable software.
           </t>
           <t>Names of PSDs participating in PSD DMARC must be registered this
	       new registry.  New entries are assigned only for PSDs that
	       require use of DMARC.  The requirement has to be documented in a
	       manner that satisfies the terms of Expert Review, per <xref
	       target="RFC8126"/>.  The Designated Expert needs to confirm that
	       provided documentation adequately describes PSD policy to require
	       domain owners to use DMARC or that all domain owners are part of
	       a single organization with the PSO.
           </t>
           <t>The initial set of entries in this registry is as follows:
            <figure><artwork>

        <section anchor="pslplus" title="DMARC PSD PSL Extension">
           <t> <xref target="psddmarc.org"/> provides a file formatted like the
               Public Suffix List (PSL) in order to
               facilitate identification of PSD DMARC participants.  Contents are
               functionally identical to the IANA like registry, but presented in
               a different format.
           </t>
	   <t> When using this approach, the input domain of the extension lookup
               is supposed to be the output domain of the regular PSL lookup, i.e.,
               the organizational domain.  This alternative data approach is
               potentially useful since DMARC implementations already need to be
               able to parse the data format, so it should be easier to implement.
