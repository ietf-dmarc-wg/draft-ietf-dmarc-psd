DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
                 Extension For TLDs (Top Level Domains)
                      draft-kitterman-dmarc-tld-00

Abstract

   DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and
   Conformance) is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating
   organization can express domain-level policies and preferences for
   message validation, disposition, and reporting, that a mail-receiving
   organization can use to improve mail handling.  DMARC itself does not
   apply to TLDs (Top Level Domains).  For the subset of TLDs that
   require DMARC usage, it is appropriate to provide TLD level DMARC
   capability.  This memo describes an extension to DMARC to enable a
   subset of DMARC functionality for such TLDs.

1.  Introduction

   DMARC [RFC7489] provides email sending organizational policy
   information to email receivers.  Due to the design of DMARC [RFC7489]
   and the nature of the Internet email architecture [RFC5598], there
   are interoperability issues associated with DMARC [RFC7489]
   deployment.  These are discused in Interoperability Issues between
   DMARC and Indirect Email Flows [RFC7960].  These issues are not
   applicable to TLDs, since they do not send mail.

Internet-Draft                  TLD DMARC                    August 2018


   DMARC [RFC7489], by design, does not support requirements of TLD
   operators.  For TLDs that require use of DMARC [RFC7489], a subset of
   DMARC reporting and enforcement capability is needed for TLD
   operators to effectively manage and monitor implementation of TLD
   requirements.

   Additionally, the ability to extend DMARC [RFC7489] policy to operate
   against non-existent domains would enhance its utility for TLD
   Operators as well as Domain Owners.  Originally, DMARC [RFC7489]
   included this functionality, but it was removed after significant
   operational issues were discovered.  This memo adds a new DMARC
   [RFC7489] record tag to provide this capability on an optional, opt-
   in basis.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

2.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]  when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Top Level Domain (TLD)

   The global Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is documented in
   numerous Requests for Comment (RFC).  It defines a tree of names
   starting with root, ".", immediately below which are Top Level Domain
   names such as ".com" and ".us".

2.3.  TLD Operator (TLDO)

   A TLD Operator manages operations within their TLD based on guidance
   and rules from ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
   Numbers).

2.4.  TLDO Controlled Domain Names

   TLDO Controlled Domain Names are names in the DNS that are managed by
   TLDOs and not available for use as organizational domains (the term
   organizational domains is defined in DMARC [RFC7489]).  Depending on
   TLD policy, these will have one (e.g. ".com") or more (e.g. ".co.uk")
   or more name components.

2.5.  Non-existent Domains

   For DMARC [RFC7489] purposes, a non-existent domain is a domain name
   that publishes none of A, AAAA, or MX records.  This is a broader
   definition than that in NXDOMAIN [RFC8020].

3.  TLD DMARC Updates to DMARC Requirements

   This document updates DMARC [RFC7489] as follows:

3.1.  General Updates

   References to "Domain Owners" also apply to TLDOs.

3.2.  Section 6.1 DMARC Policy Record

   TLD DMARC records are published as a subdomain of the TLD.  For the
   TLD ".example", the TLDO would post DMARC preferences in a TXT record
   at "_dmarc.example".

3.3.  Section 6.3.  General Record Format

   The rf and ruf tags are not applicable to TLD DMARC and MUST be
   ignored for TLD records.

3.4.  Section 6.5.  Domain Owner Actions

   In addition to the DMARC [RFC7489] domain owner actions, TLDOs will
   need to update the "DMARC TLD Registry".  See IANA Considerations
   below.

3.5.  Section 6.6.3.  Policy Discovery

   A new step between step 3 and 4 is added:

   3A.  If the set is now empty and the TLD of the Organizational Domain
      is listed in the DMARC TLD Registry, the Mail Receiver MUST query
      the DNS for a DMARC TXT record at the DNS domain matching the TLD
      in place of the RFC5322.From domain in the message (if different).
      This record can contain policy to be asserted for subdomains of
      the TLD.  A possibly empty set of records is returned.

3.6.  7.2.  Aggregate Reports

   NOTE: We would like to modify this section to allow multiple nxdomain
   subdomain reports to be reported in a single report.  This would also
   require changes in the Appendix C XML schema.  Recommend defering

   this to discussion in the IETF DMARC working group where the authors
   of the original design that disallows this can weigh in.

3.7.  7.3.  Failure Reports

   This section is not applicable to records identified via policy
   discovery step 3A.

4.  Non-existent Domain Requirements

4.1.  Section 6.3.  General Record Format

   A new "np" tag is added:

   np:  Requested Mail Receiver policy for all non-existent domains
      (plain-text; OPTIONAL).  Indicates the policy to be enacted by the
      Receiver at the request of the Domain Owner.  It applies only to
      subdomains of the domain queried and not to the domain itself.
      Its syntax is identical to that of the "p" tag defined above.  If
      absent, DMARC policy MUST NOT be applied for non-existent domains.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not change significantly change the Privacy
   Considerations of [RFC7489].  Privacy considerations related to
   Failure Reports do not apply to TLD DMARC.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change the Security Considerations of
   [RFC7489].

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes actions requested to be completed by IANA.

7.1.  DMARC Tag Registry Update

   IANA is requested to add the following item to the registry:

   +--------+-----------+---------+------------------------------------+
   |  Tag   | Reference | Status  | Description                        |
   |  Name  |           |         |                                    |
   +--------+-----------+---------+------------------------------------+
   |   np   | this      | current | Requested handling policy for non- |
   |        | document  |         | existent domains                   |
   +--------+-----------+---------+------------------------------------+

7.2.  DMARC Top Level Domain (TLD) Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new DMARC Top Level Domain (TLD)
   Registry within the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
   and Conformance (DMARC) Parameters Registry.

   Names of TLDs participating in TLD DMARC must be registered with IANA
   in this new sub-registry.  New entries are assigned only for TLDs
   that require use of DMARC.  The requirement has to be documented in a
   manner that satisfies the terms of Expert Review, per [RFC5226].  The
   Designated Expert needs to confirm that provided documentation
   adequately describes TLD policy to require domain owners to use
   DMARC.

   The initial set of entries in this registry is as follows:

   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   |    TLD      | Reference      | Status        |
   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   | .bank       | this document  | current       |
   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   | .insurance  | this document  | current       |
   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
