DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
                 Extension For TLDs (Top Level Domains)
                      draft-kitterman-dmarc-tld-00

Abstract

   DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and
   Conformance) is a scalable mechanism by which a mail-originating
   organization can express domain-level policies and preferences for
   message validation, disposition, and reporting, that a mail-receiving
   organization can use to improve mail handling.  DMARC itself does not
   apply to domains above the organizational level, such as TLDs (Top
   Level Domains).  For the subset of TLDs (or other non-organizational
   domains) that require DMARC usage, it is appropriate to provide TLD
   level DMARC capability.  This memo describes an extension to DMARC to
   enable a subset of DMARC functionality for such domains.

1.  Introduction

   DMARC [RFC7489] provides email sending organizational policy
   information to email receivers.  Due to the design of DMARC [RFC7489]
   and the nature of the Internet email architecture [RFC5598], there
   are interoperability issues associated with DMARC [RFC7489]
   deployment.  These are discussed in Interoperability Issues between
   DMARC and Indirect Email Flows [RFC7960].  These issues are not
   applicable to TLDs, since they do not send mail.

   DMARC [RFC7489], by design, does not support requirements of TLD
   operators.  For TLDs that require use of DMARC [RFC7489], a subset of
   DMARC reporting and enforcement capability is needed for TLD

   operators to effectively manage and monitor implementation of TLD
   requirements.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

2.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174]  when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.2.  Top Level Domain (TLD)

   The global Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is documented in
   numerous Requests for Comment (RFC).  It defines a tree of names
   starting with root, ".", immediately below which are Top Level Domain
   names such as ".com" and ".us".  The usage for TLD DMARC is broader
   and includes all domains above the organizational level in the tree,
   e.g., ".gov.uk".

2.3.  TLD Operator (TLDO)

   A TLD Operator manages operations within their TLD.

2.4.  TLDO Controlled Domain Names

   TLDO Controlled Domain Names are names in the DNS that are managed by
   a TLDO and not available for use as Organizational Domains (the term
   organizational domains is defined in DMARC [RFC7489]).  Depending on
   TLD policy, these will have one (e.g., ".com") or more (e.g.,
   ".co.uk") name components.

2.5.  Non-existent Domains

   For DMARC [RFC7489] purposes, a non-existent domain is a domain name
   that publishes none of A, AAAA, or MX records.  This is a broader
   definition than that in NXDOMAIN [RFC8020].

3.  TLD DMARC Updates to DMARC Requirements

   This document updates DMARC [RFC7489] as follows:

Internet-Draft                  TLD DMARC                   October 2018


3.1.  General Updates

   References to "Domain Owners" also apply to TLDOs.

3.2.  Section 6.1 DMARC Policy Record

   TLD DMARC records are published as a subdomain of the TLD.  For the
   TLD ".example", the TLDO would post DMARC preferences in a TXT record
   at "_dmarc.example".

3.3.  Section 6.5.  Domain Owner Actions

   In addition to the DMARC [RFC7489] domain owner actions, TLDOs will
   need to update the "DMARC Top Level Domain (TLD) Registry".  This
   registry is defined in Section 6.1.

3.4.  Section 6.6.3.  Policy Discovery

   A new step between step 3 and 4 is added:

   3A.  If the set is now empty and the TLD of the Organizational Domain
      is listed in the DMARC TLD Registry, the Mail Receiver MUST query
      the DNS for a DMARC TXT record at the DNS domain matching the
      Organizational Domain with one label removed in place of the
      RFC5322.From domain in the message (if different).  A possibly
      empty set of records is returned.

   As an example, for a message with the Organizational Domain of
   "example.compute.amazonaws.com.cn", the query for TLD DMARC would use
   "_dmarc.compute.amazonaws.com.cn".

3.5.  Section 7.  DMARC Feedback

   Operational note for TLD DMARC: For TLDOs, feedback for non-existent
   domains is desired and useful.  Because of the constraints on TLD
   DMARC scope, there are not significant privacy considerations
   associated with this reporting (See Section 4).

4.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not significantly change the Privacy
   Considerations of [RFC7489].

4.1.  Feedback leakage

   Providing feedback reporting to TLDOs can, in some cases, create
   leakage of information outside of an organization to the TLDO.  There
   are roughly three cases to consider:



Kitterman                 Expires April 9, 2019                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  TLD DMARC                   October 2018


   o  Branded TLDs (e.g., ".google"), RUA and RUF reports based on TLD
      DMARC have the potential to contain information about emails
      related to entities managed by the organization.  Since both the
      TLDO and the Organizational Domain owners are common, there is no
      privacy risk for either normal or Non-existent Domain reporting.

   o  Multi-organization TLDs that require DMARC usage (e.g., ".bank"):
      TLD DMARC based reports will only be generated for domains that do
      not publish a DMARC policy at the organizational level.  For
      domains that do publish the required DMARC policy records, the
      feedback reporting addresses (RUA and RUF) of the organization
      will be used.  Since TLD DMARC is limited to TLDs that mandate
      organizational domains publish DMARC policy for existing domains,
      the risk of this issue is limited to organizational domains that
      are out of compliance with TLD policy.

   o  Multi-organization TLDs (e.g., ".com") that do not mandate DMARC
      usage.  Privacy risks for organizational domains within such TLDs
      would be significant.  This is mitigated by the limitation to only
      include TLDs listed in the public IANA DMARC TLD Registry
      described in Section 6.1.

   TLDOs will receive feedback on non-existant domains, which may be
   similar to existing organizational domains.  Feedback related to such
   cousin domains have a small risk of carrying information related to
   an actual organizational domain.  To minimize this potential concern,
   TLD DMARC feedback is best limited to Aggregate Reports.  Feedback
   Reports carry more detailed information and present a greater risk.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change the Security Considerations of
   [RFC7489].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes actions requested to be completed by IANA.

6.1.  DMARC Top Level Domain (TLD) Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new DMARC Top Level Domain (TLD)
   Registry within the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,
   and Conformance (DMARC) Parameters Registry.

   Names of TLDs participating in TLD DMARC must be registered with IANA
   in this new sub-registry.  New entries are assigned only for TLDs
   that require use of DMARC.  The requirement has to be documented in a
   manner that satisfies the terms of Expert Review, per [RFC5226].  The

Internet-Draft                  TLD DMARC                   October 2018


   Designated Expert needs to confirm that provided documentation
   adequately describes TLD policy to require domain owners to use DMARC
   or that all domain owners are part of a single organization with the
   TLDO.

   The initial set of entries in this registry is as follows:

   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   |    TLD      | Reference      | Status        |
   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   | .bank       | this document  | current       |
   +-------------+----------------+---------------+
   | .insurance  | this document  | current       |
